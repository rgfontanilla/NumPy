# NumPy

This repository contains two files for NumPy's ufunc Simple Arithmetic functions. Both are created in Jupyter Notebook, with the first having each variable run in a single cell. Even though the executions are all correct, I still get an error about the 'np' name not being defined. My suspicion is that I keep getting the error because the array lists are in a separate cell.

Meanwhile, the second version, v2.0, is the new version I created that works perfectly fine. What I did was combine arrays, variables, and functions into a single cell, which fortunately no longer produces an error.
